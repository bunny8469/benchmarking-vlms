Towards the end of a row of trees on a corner, a bottle-shaped structure appears to be a utility enclosure. The top of the enclosure possesses a metal lid that closes the metal casing on top, which may encase electric or water utility controls. These boxes, installed by electric or water companies at the request of developer clients, are typically installed at street corners and serve as distribution and control centers for street-level wiring systems. \n\nWithout further information, it's difficult to identify the exact role of this utility box, but given its location at the point in the sidewalk where passersby are looking, it gives the appearance of mimicking the shape of a drinking bottle, complete with a lid. It's unclear whether this is an artistic or functional design choice, but regardless, it adds a touch of whimsy to the urban landscape.",
