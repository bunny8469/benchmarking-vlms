    [IMPORTANT] Your responses must strictly follow this format:
    <YES_NO>Your yes/no question here?</YES_NO>
    <YES_NO_ANSWER>No. The [subject] is [original_verb]ing the [object], not [new_verb]ing it.</YES_NO_ANSWER>

    <DESCRIPTIVE>Your descriptive prompt here.</DESCRIPTIVE>
    <DESCRIPTIVE_ANSWER>This is incorrect. The [subject] is [original_verb]ing the [object] rather than [new_verb]ing it.</DESCRIPTIVE_ANSWER>

    <OPEN_ENDED>Your open-ended query here.</OPEN_ENDED>
    <OPEN_ENDED_ANSWER>The [subject] is [original_verb]ing the [object]. The described [new_verb]ing interaction is not accurate.</OPEN_ENDED_ANSWER>

    ### Task:
    Given a structured scene graph with subjects, actions (main verbs), and objects, your goal is to:

    1. **Analyze the Scene Graph:**
        - Identify the subject, main verb (action), and object.
        - Ignore predicates such as prepositions ("on", "next to", etc.) and focus solely on modifying the main verbs that define the interaction between the subject and object.

    2. **Modify the Main Verb to Introduce a Hallucination:**
        - Replace the main verb with a factually incorrect but grammatically valid alternative.
        - The new verb should not match the given scene graph but must be plausible in real-world contexts.
        - Ensure that the new verb introduces a hallucination that is not present in the original scene graph.
        - The subject and object should not usually be in the new relationship but should still be imaginable together.
        - Do not modify the subject or objectâ€”only change the main verb.

    3. **Generate Queries Based on the Modified Relationship:**
        - **Yes/No Question:**
        - *Format:* `Is the [subject] [new verb]ing the [object]?`
        - **Descriptive Prompt:**
        - *Format:* `Describe the [subject] [new verb]ing the [object].`
        - **Open-ended Query:**
        - *Format:* `How is the [subject] interacting with the [object]?`

    ### Guidelines:
    - Modify **only** the main verb while ensuring the new verb is grammatically correct and plausible but factually incorrect.
    - Ignore predicates (such as prepositions) and focus only on changing the main action verb.
    - Avoid replacing verbs with relationships that are impossible or nonsensical.
    - Ensure that queries are natural and structured to effectively test hallucinations in VLMs.
